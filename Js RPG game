//Intro
confirm("For years, the great country of Great Toaster thrived with much trade and happiness. The country soon became immensely rich due to it's lucridious trade. Fortunately, the wealth brought only happiness to the residents of Great Toaster, and the country rose in population. Not long after the expansion of the country, the greedy and merciless beast Argumenthus came to reside in the neighboring mountains. He promised to raze and level the country if not for the sacrifice of 20 men and women from Great Toaster and treasure galore each year. With Argumenthus in the mountains around Great Toaster, traders were afraid to continue their business in Great Toaster, so they left, leaving Great Toaster with small income, very little food, and resources. For years Great Toaster has lived in this state of constant peril, but now, you, the champion of Great Toaster has been called upon to rid the once glorious country of the blight known as Argumenthus and return Great Toaster to it's former glory.");
